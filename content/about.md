Hi! My name is Robert. An avid learner.

I have been involved in a variety of different projects that doesn't "neatly" characterise my career - quality assurance and project management over system implementations, business process re-engineering, piloting a data visualization technology using Microsoft Power BI. It's different, its exciting, it makes me flexible.

Currently, I am leading a diverse and energetic team to develop and implement from scratch an Innovation Management function to help staff create new value for our business and customers. It is truly an exciting journey that pulls different experiences together.

One interesting fact - I'm passionate about learning new things! This has served me well in understanding a diversity of different business issues. Currently, I have developed a passion for Data Analytics and R (though I know Python is good too!) and I'm using this blog to share my learnings for others to benefit.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [drop me a direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_muwanga).

Thanks for reading!
