Hi! My name is Robert.

I have been involved in a variety of different projects that doesn't "neatly" characterise my career - innovation, project management, business process re-engineering, data analyst, performance management and strategic "think tank" helping build departmental strategies for execution. One could think of me as a "roaming consultant", and this non-traditional approach to work has helped me touch on many areas of business and see how many of the "cogs fit into the engine".

Currently, I am leading a diverse and energetic team to develop and implement from scratch an Innovation Management function to help staff create new value for our business and customers. It is truly an exciting journey that pulls all my different experiences together, and one that keeps me learning.

One interesting fact - I'm passionate about learning new things! This has served me well in understanding a diversity of different business issues and keeps me open-minded to new realities.

One of my biggest passions is Data Analytics, particularly in R (though I know Python is good too!). I'm by no means an Data Scientists but I am working on that and I'm using this blog to share my learnings for others to benefit.

I'll also be posting my random musings on other experiences that I learn along the way, and I hope this blog will be as interesting to you as it is to me.

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [drop me a direct message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/r_muwanga).

Thanks for reading!
