      <description>As analysts, we oftentimes make the mistake of diving straight into building reports without fully appreciating the data that is given to us.

      <description>There are instances where you make a data request and you receive data in a PDF. Naturally, this presents a problem - how do you load it into R?&#xA;As a simple example, I was interested in getting some data on Uganda’s education system. The data I was able to find was on Uganda’s USE and UPOLET ENLORMENT by Local Government / District that can be found here.&#xA;As a bit of a background on the acronyms:</description>

      <description>As a manager, one of your biggest challenges is being able to identify opportunities - I prefer calling it opportunities instead of “problems” - where we can improve the performance of a process under our control.&#xA;Let’s put this into context. As a manager you may be responsible for the performance of a consistent, sequential process that involves receiving stock from suppliers:&#xA;The delivery truck docks at the delivery point in the warehouse.</description>

      <description>As I was strolling through reddit and came across an interesting data cleaning request by u/PoisonDaddy29.&#xA;Breaking down the request, it seemed like a typical transposing problem, but with an interesting twist - with grouped data.&#xA;Let’s break this down a bit.&#xA;This is the original sample data:&#xA;sample_data&#xA;And this is the expected output data: Looking at the output and working towards the original data, you will notice a couple of things:</description>

      <description>The other day I was asked about public holidays in my home country - and if you didn’t know, I am from Uganda. So this question got me thinking that it would make for a good post to practice how I could scrape the information I need to answer this question.&#xA;Step 0 - What do you need? For this exercise, you will need to install R, Rstudio (or any other text editor that you prefer to use) and the following packages:</description>

      <description>Courtesy DeepAI image&#xA;A lot has been talked about when it comes to Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Some see it as the “holy grail” to improving organisational performance, whilst others see it as “just another performance management tool”. But, as a mental model, it works well in driving daily performance expectations, projects, and innovation discovery and creation.&#xA;So, how can OKRs support innovation? Let’s first understand briefly what OKRs are all about.</description>
