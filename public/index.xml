A lot has been talked about when it comes to Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Some see it as the “holy grail” to improving organisational performance, whilst others see it as “just another performance management tool”. But, as a mental model, it works well in driving daily performance expectations, projects, and innovation discovery and creation.

      <description>Hi! My name is Robert.
I have been involved in a variety of different projects that doesn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;neatly&amp;rdquo; characterise my career - innovation, project management, business process re-engineering, data analyst, performance management and strategic &amp;ldquo;think tank&amp;rdquo; helping build departmental strategies for execution. One could think of me as a &amp;ldquo;roaming consultant&amp;rdquo;, and this non-traditional approach to work has helped me touch on many areas of business and see how many of the &amp;ldquo;cogs fit into the engine&amp;rdquo;.</description>
